# Sketch Web Framework

## Learning objectives
- Good understanding and implementation of MVC pattern
- Understanding the namespacing and PSR-4 standard
- Developing routing using .htacess file
- Understanding and developing ORM

## The Mission
I am trying to develop a framework based on MVC pattern using PHP. I would try to add all (if not all then at least important and useful one) features that a modern PHP frameworks provide right now. Moroever, I want to develop a complete web framework, not just a backend framework or frontend framework.

## Strategy
The strategy will be to start from basic and easy features and add one after another. I will divide my codes into two main directories, one for the core class which is fixed and won't change, and other to add codes for developers and to work on.

## Basic features
- Routing
- View
- Model
- ORM
- CLI
- Validation
- Multilingual support
- Security against threats like SQL Injection and CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
- Simple File System
- Middlewares
- Authentication

## Challenge
Coding or developing basic codes for all of these tasks separately might not be as big problem as managing these codes to work simultaneously whenever and however it is supposed to work.
Even more, a framework needs a user's guide or proper documentation, which could be one of the most difficult task for me. Once I will be somewhere in the middle of the task, I will create another repo to host my documentation and serve it on github server live.

## What's next?
This could be a never ending project and can maintain it as long as possible, which is different thing. I have an idea of expanding this framework with JS and make it in same was as a frontend framework like Angular, react or Vue works but with inbuilt default Backend support with PHP. The idea is that, the developer could create and write PHP codes but then framework divides these codes into js and PHP and executes as required. In this way, a PHP developer who like to on PHP have an advantages of working only on PHp but actually working on both frontend and backend with writing a single line of JS or writing minimum amount of JS code.

## The problem
For the what's next part, it is just an idea.I have still not developed any particular way of achieving it. And it may not work as expected, or even I would not be able to find a way out to make it happen as I wanted to do. So for me at this moment, I am not sure about it, but once I finish all the basic requirements, I will definitely work hard to make it possible as I expected.
